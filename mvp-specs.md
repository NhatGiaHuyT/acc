**AI Contract Check: MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**1. Introduction**

Individuals like freelancers, small business owners, and consumers frequently encounter contracts (service agreements, NDAs, leases, etc.) they need to understand but lack the time, expertise, or resources for a traditional legal review. AI Contract Check aims to provide a fast, affordable, and easy-to-understand first-pass analysis to highlight potential risks and key terms, empowering users to make more informed decisions before signing or seeking formal legal advice. This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

**2. Goals**

* **User Goal:** Enable users to quickly upload a standard contract and receive a simple, actionable summary of potential risks and key information.
* **Business Goal (MVP):** Validate the core value proposition, attract initial users, gather feedback for iteration, and test basic pricing models.

**3. Target Audience (MVP)**

* Individuals (freelancers, gig workers, consumers, very small business owners) receiving relatively common/standard contracts (e.g., simple service agreements, NDAs, residential leases, basic employment offers).
* Users who need a quick risk assessment and summary, not comprehensive legal advice or negotiation tools.
* Primarily English-language contracts for MVP.

**4. MVP Features**

* **F1: User Account Creation (Minimal)**
    * **F1.1:** Allow users to sign up using email and password or Google
    * **F1.2:** Basic password recovery mechanism.
    * *(Rationale: Needed for usage tracking across tiers and basic user identification).*
* **F2: Contract Upload**
    * **F2.1:** Provide a simple "Upload Contract" button on the user dashboard.
    * **F2.2:** Accept file uploads in `.pdf` format (must contain selectable text, not image-only).
    * **F2.3:** Accept file uploads in `.docx` format.
    * **F2.4:** Implement a reasonable file size limit (e.g., 10MB) for MVP.
    * **F2.5:** Provide clear feedback during upload (e.g., progress indicator) and confirmation upon successful upload.
    * *(Rationale: Core input mechanism. Start with most common editable/readable formats).*
* **F3: AI Contract Analysis Engine**
    * **F3.1:** Parse uploaded text from supported file formats.
    * **F3.2:** Utilize AI (e.g., fine-tuned LLM or specialized API) to analyze the contract text.
    * **F3.3:** **Identify & Extract Key Information:** Attempt to identify and extract basic terms such as:
        * Apparent Parties to the agreement.
        * Contract Duration / Term Length (if clearly stated).
        * Governing Law / Jurisdiction (if clearly stated).
    * **F3.4:** **Identify Potential Risk Areas/Warnings:** Scan for and flag common clauses or terms known to be potentially unfavorable or requiring attention in standard contracts (examples):
        * Broad liability limitations / waivers.
        * One-sided indemnification clauses.
        * Ambiguous or unfavorable termination clauses.
        * Automatic renewal clauses without clear notification requirements.
        * Unusual confidentiality obligations.
        * Assignment clauses (ability to transfer the contract).
        * Non-compete or non-solicitation clauses (in employment/contractor agreements).
        * *(Note: MVP focuses on flagging *potential* issues based on common patterns, not exhaustive legal analysis or context-specific advice).*
* **F4: Results Display**
    * **F4.1:** Display results on a clean, simple web page after processing is complete.
    * **F4.2:** Show an **Overall Summary:** A high-level indicator (e.g., "Potential Risks Detected: Low / Medium / High" or a simple count of flagged items).
    * **F4.3:** Display **Extracted Key Information** (from F3.3) in a clear list.
    * **F4.4:** Display **Risks & Warnings Section:**
        * List each identified potential risk area (from F3.4).
        * Provide a *brief*, plain-language explanation for *each* flagged item (e.g., "Liability Clause: This clause appears to significantly limit the other party's responsibility if something goes wrong.").
        * *Crucially:* Do NOT provide specific legal advice or suggest alternative wording in MVP. Focus on highlighting *what* was found and *why* it might warrant attention.
    * **F4.5:** Include a prominent link to the Legal Disclaimer (F5).
* **F5: Legal Disclaimer**
    * **F5.1:** Display a clear, unavoidable disclaimer during signup and near the results display.
    * **F5.2:** Content must state that AI Contract Check provides informational insights only, is *not* a substitute for legal advice, does not create an attorney-client relationship, and accuracy is not guaranteed. Recommend consulting a qualified lawyer for important matters.

**5. Non-Goals (Features NOT included in MVP)**

* Contract drafting, editing, or clause suggestion/replacement.
* Direct comparison against user templates or clause libraries.
* Redlining or negotiation tools.
* Support for image-only PDFs (OCR).
* Integrations with cloud storage or other systems.
* Multi-language support beyond English.
* Collaboration features (sharing results, commenting).
* Long-term contract storage and management repository.
* Advanced analytics or reporting.
* Mobile application.
* Handling of highly complex, non-standard, or industry-specific contracts.

**6. Design & UX Considerations**

* Simple, clean, intuitive user interface.
* Clear call-to-actions (Upload, View Results).
* Easy-to-read presentation of results. Prioritize clarity over density.
* Ensure responsiveness for standard desktop and mobile web browsers.

**7. Data & Privacy**

* Uploaded contracts and analysis results must be handled securely (e.g., encryption in transit and at rest).
* Define a clear data retention policy for MVP (e.g., retain documents only for processing and results display, then delete, or retain for a very short period like 7 days on paid tiers). Communicate this policy to users.

**8. Pricing Packages (MVP)**

* **Tier 1: Free Trial**
    * **Offer:** 1 Free contract review upon signup.
