### Notes
- System architecture is fully operational
- Core features are implemented and tested
- Subscription system is working well
- AI analysis shows good initial results
- Need to focus on accuracy improvements

### AI Analysis Improvements Needed
1. Better extraction of key dates and deadlines
2. More accurate identification of non-standard clauses
3. Improved risk scoring for complex conditions
4. Better handling of legal terminology variations
5. Enhanced detection of missing critical clauses
6. Improved confidence scoring calibration
7. Better handling of contract variations by industry
8. Enhanced detection of conflicting clauses

### AI Prompt Strategy
The AI analysis follows this structured approach:
1. Initial document scan and structure validation
2. Extract key contract metadata (parties, dates, terms)
3. Identify and analyze standard and critical clauses
4. Detect potential risks and unusual terms
5. Compare against standard templates
6. Analyze clause interactions and conflicts
7. Generate risk assessment with confidence scores
8. Provide specific recommendations
9. Flag areas needing human review

### Implementation Updates
- Added granular risk assessment criteria
- Improved clause detection accuracy
- Enhanced confidence scoring system
- Added contract template comparison
- Implemented strict type safety
- Added validation for AI responses
- Improved error handling and recovery

### Authentication System Updates
- Implemented robust error handling with standardized responses
- Added strong input validation using Zod schemas
- Integrated Google OAuth with secure token handling
- Added type-safe JWT implementation
- Improved password security with bcrypt
- Added detailed validation error messages
- Implemented defensive null checks for enhanced reliability
- Added comprehensive error logging
